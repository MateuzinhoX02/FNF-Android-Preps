FileSystem dont work in android, right?

Based in [MobileSys](https://github.com/Musk-h/Forever-Engine-Android/blob/main/source/android/MobileSys.hx). I used some tools of OpenFLAssets and Lime Assets.
I'am not a professional, and i dont know everything of code, i just created this to help me and other porters from Friday Night Funkin' mods.

## Features
This tool contains these functions:
Play Video Cutscenes,
Precache of Sprites, 
Precache of Songs, 
FileSystem's alternatives.

## Warnings!
Some commands are bugged! (will be fixed)
You have to use a modified git of Extension-Webview,
for special motives, use:
